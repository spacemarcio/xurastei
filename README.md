## Find a place to buy or rent can be hard

There are too many sources to look for properties. Xurastei ou Xuraigou help people make segmented searches to find ads near their personal routines.

## How Xurastei ou Xuraigou works?

It takes public data from neighborhoods to identify clusters of places. Some neibourhoods can be distant, but have same characteristics, like good green areas and many markets, for example. Then, collects ads from principal sources from Recife' properties and identifies which ads belong to which kind of place.

## Project presentation

You can find very nice slides [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAErzzYvh_M/QsxB75L-e490gy0vCPS5jw/view?utm_content=DAErzzYvh_M&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink).

## Technologies

In this project we make web scraping using (Selenium and Docker Containers), orchestration with Airflow, feature engineering with geospatial data using PostGIS (an extension to PostgreSQL), clustering data from RDS using K-Means and Infrastructure as Code. Yeah! A lot of cool things.
