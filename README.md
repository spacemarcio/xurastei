## Find a place to buy or rent can be hard

There are too many sources to look for properties. Xurastei ou Xuraigou help people make segmented searches to find ads near their personal routines.

## How Xurastei ou Xuraigou works?

It takes public data from neighborhoods to identify clusters of places. Some neibourhoods can be distant, but have same characteristics, like good green areas and many markets, for example. Then, collects ads from principal sources from Recife' properties and identifies which ads belong to which kind of place.

## Project architecture (for now)

## CDC strategy

We cannot scrapping all data every the time, it takes to much resources. So we need a CDC (Change Data Capture) strategy to maintain Xurastei ou Xuraigou fresh to date.
